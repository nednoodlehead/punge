# Punge
Punge is an Application for listening to music. It downloads songs from YouTube and provides a based listening experience. I hate streaming services, let me listen to my stinky unreleased music.

This is a newer version of Punge. As of now, only [old punge](https://github.com/nednoodlehead/old_punge) is working.
Punge uses `rodio` for playing audio and `Iced` for GUI.

New Punge brings on multiple improvements:

1) Improved preformance (significant)
2) A nicer GUI (from Tkinter -> Iced)
3) More sustainable and cleaner codebase
4) Written entirely in rust ! ðŸ¦€
5) Much cleaner and nicer interface for audio (we aint using pydub for that no more!)
6) Fully commented codebase
7) Playlist metadata
8) Better data about each individiual song

This experimental branch is a version of Punge that is going to be worked on and completed first. This uses threads more similarly to how original Punge did. It also does unsafe implementations for various parts of it. Compromising certain parts. The master branch should be the one that is stable and made with best practice. This will be the 'working' version.
