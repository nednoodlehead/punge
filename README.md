# Punge
This is a newer version of Punge. As of now, only [old punge](https://github.com/nednoodlehead/old_punge) is working.

New Punge brings on multiple improvements:

1) Improved preformance (significant)
2) A nicer GUI (from Tkinter -> PyQt5)
3) More sustainable and cleaner codebase
4) More Rust ! ðŸ¦€
5) Much cleaner and nicer MusicPlayer class
6) Fully commented codebase
7) Playlist metadata
8) Better data about each individiual song
