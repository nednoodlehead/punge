# Punge
Punge is an Application for listening to music. It downloads songs from YouTube and provides a based listening experience. I hate streaming services, let me listen to my stinky unreleased music.

This is a newer version of Punge. As of now, only [old punge](https://github.com/nednoodlehead/old_punge) is working.
Punge uses `ffmpegio` for playing audio and `PyQt5` for GUI.

New Punge brings on multiple improvements:

1) Improved preformance (significant)
2) A nicer GUI (from Tkinter -> PyQt5)
3) More sustainable and cleaner codebase
4) More Rust ! ðŸ¦€
5) Much cleaner and nicer MusicPlayer class (we aint using pydub for that no more!)
6) Fully commented codebase
7) Playlist metadata
8) Better data about each individiual song
