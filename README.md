# Punge
Punge is an Application for listening to music. It downloads songs from YouTube and provides a based listening experience. I hate streaming services, let me listen to my stinky unreleased music.

This is a newer version of Punge. As of now, it is missing some important features (visually seeing your music, lol), but works fine for playing and downloading music
Punge uses `rodio` for playing audio and `Iced` for GUI.

New Punge brings on multiple improvements:

1) Improved preformance (significant)
2) A nicer GUI (from Tkinter -> Iced)
3) More sustainable and cleaner codebase
4) Written entirely in rust ! ðŸ¦€
5) Much cleaner and nicer interface for audio (we aint using pydub for that no more!)
6) Fully commented codebase
7) Playlist metadata
8) Better data about each individiual song
